# X86-Assembly-Programing
Code used in my X86 Assembly Programming Labs for computer architecture 
1) hello.asm will simply print out hello world to the screen.
2) Ian10.asm will print ian to the screen 10 times first time working with loops.
3)pats.asm this will print out the numbers from 0-9 starting with 0 and then moving to a new line each time it makes the number longer.
4)typer.asm this will take in anykey that is enterted and only output it if it is a number key between 0 and 9.
5)alpha.asm will take in user input and capatilize the letters which are inoutted and print them out it uses the subtract method to find the capital version of a letter.
6)bench.asm will test the speed of your CPU in the computer.
7)float.asm executes the equation a^3+sqrt(b) using floating point aritmetic.
8)MASM_FP.EXE does the same as float.asm execpt that it uses c code to run as an app and assembly code to do the floating point aritmetic.
9)App1.EXE is a stopwatch app which was developed by me to help me better understand event driven programming.
10)cols.asm will print out my initals in the 10 colum on the 12 row and in two different colours.
