# X86-Assembly-Programing
Code used in my X86 Assembly Programming Labs for computer architecture 
1) hello.asm will simply print out hello world to the screen.
2) Ian10.asm will print ian to the screen 10 times first time working with loops.
3)pats.asm this will print out the numbers from 0-9 starting with 0 and then moving to a new line each time it makes the number longer.
